# ReCarnation: The Ultimate Platform for Buying and Selling Pre-Owned Cars

The increasing need for cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation has led to notable expansion in the used car market. Our project addresses this demand by developing a user-friendly, secure web application that streamlines the process of buying and selling pre-owned vehicles. 

The application is deployed on AWS, transforming it into a scalable, cloud-hosted solution capable of handling increased traffic and user activity with ease. 

The application features a clean and intuitive interface. Users can securely sign in using either regular login credentials or Okta, ensuring safe and easy access. 

After logging in, the homepage offers direct access to key features—"Buy" and "Sell" cars. 

On the Buy page, users can explore listings using an advanced search and filtering system, with the option to view results in grid or list format. Each listing includes a detailed page showcasing specifications, condition, and pricing to help buyers make informed decisions. 

On the Sell page, sellers can easily submit their vehicle details—such as make, model, year, mileage, and price—through a guided form. Listings appear in both general search results and the seller’s personal profile once submitted. 

The platform also includes an administrative system where admins can review, approve, or reject listings before publication, manage sold and unsold vehicles, and control user permissions. 

A standout feature is the price predictor, which uses data analysis to recommend optimal pricing based on market trends and car details. 

The back-end is powered by database that securely handles user data, vehicle listings, and transaction history. Additionally, the platform integrates Jenkins for continuous integration and automated testing, ensuring consistent reliability and streamlined updates. 

The application is robust, flexible, and prepared for real-world usage. It aims to revolutionize the pre-owned car market by offering a transparent, efficient, and secure digital experience for both buyers and sellers.

## Local Setup Instructions

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/juniemariam/Recarnation-NanoClouds.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Recarnation-NanoClouds
```

You can also create and use virtual environment

Install dependencies
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Create a PostgreSQL database named "cardealer_db"
- Configure PostgreSQL Database credentials under settings.py
- Then, make database migrations

```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```
- And finally, run the application
```bash
  python manage.py runserver

```
### Admin Account
please create one using superuser
```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Setting Up On Cloud

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Recarnation-NanoClouds/recarnation-backend-infra
```

To automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure we used terraform.

Fill in the secrets in tf.vars file and then perform

```bash
  terraform init 
  terraform plan 
  terraform apply
```

Once successful resource creation and provisioning you can see the app deployed on the cloud.


**Kind Note:** We have some secrets taken off from the repo. Please use the .env and settings.py file to add yours.

## Test Cases & Results

We conducted comprehensive **functional tests** to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application. These tests cover all critical features, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

### **Summary of Functional Tests**
